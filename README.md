# WeatherDashboard
For this assignment we were supposed to create a weather application that allows the user to search for a city, recieve that cities current weather, and then store that cities data in a "Search History" column. We were also required to add a "5-day-forecast" feature that allows the user to see the forecast of their desired city over the next 5 days.
